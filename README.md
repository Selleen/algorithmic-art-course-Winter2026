# algorithmic-art-course-Winter2026

Repository to storage my personal projects for the Algorithmic Art course at UdeM

## Assigment 1

The first assignment consists of exploring the UdeM campus in search of inspiration. Then, we select an artwork we like and create a new artwork inspired by this one.

The piece I selected is located in the underground level of the Pavillon Lionel-Groulx.
